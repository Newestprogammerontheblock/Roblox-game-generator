# PROJECT INFORMATION

This project took around 6 days to complete, spread across two weekends. The idea had been in my mind for a while, but after searching the web, I couldn't find any databases or lists of games. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create one. The hardest part? Finding 105 (and counting) games.

The actual code is very simple, and anyone who comes across this project is welcome to add their own games to the list.

This project was originally intended for me and my friend, so if anything doesn't make sense, assume it's some inside joke.


# CONTRIBUTION

If you're for some reason on github but dont know how to program and want to contribute to this project copy and paste/download the games.js file into vscode or an online ide. some of my reccomendations are as follows:
- glitch (used to build this)
- scrimba (i wouldnt reccomend it, as has problems updating your changes consistently)
- replit (this might be the best option if you dont want to download anything).
  
The syntax for adding to the game list is this: ["previousGame(template text here)", "Nextgame(template text here)"].
